## Network Sensoring
### Introduction
Network sensoring involves caputing and analyzing network traffic for making inferences based on various factors related to the data available from the OSI layers handling the traffic. This could help detemine patterns for volume, type of traffic, sources and destinations including data that is not encrypted. For this very reason it would be illegal to install a network sensor on a network without prior permission and full understanding of the purpose.
